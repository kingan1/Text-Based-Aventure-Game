	The dining room has a friendly character, the bar has a friendly character and throughout the map there are 2 monsters
+1pt - rooms can have items/objects (you can only claim this point if it is possible to interact with them)
	The character can pick up swords and other items at the bar and in the dungeon, and loot
+1pt - your map can change as you play (in response to events or player actions)
	If a player chooses to go up stairs, that room is no longer there and the jail locks the player out if they enter
+1pt - there are other characters in the world with whom the player can interact
	The player can choose to have a new companion with them
+1pt - there are entities that are aggressive to the player. 
	There are 2 monsters that will attack the player/companion
1pt - if the player has the ability to fight using simple mechanics like random numbers to see whether they win
	I used a random number generator to see if the player/companion swings or if the monster swings
